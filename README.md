## Weightlifting Tracker
- This is a personal project I'm working on in my spare time, so there might be times of inactivity when I'm too busy.
- It will be a webapp for tracking progress with weightlifting.
- You can track your workouts for specific exercises by recording how the weight and how many reps you did, which will give you a score that will be saved in a database and visualized with a graph over time to see your improvement. 
- Database and user authenitication is implemented with Firebase
- Next.js and Tailwind.css are used to build the webapp
